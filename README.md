# ManiSkill2 Sense Plan Act Baselines

This repository contains some simple baselines that tackle tasks using the SPA (Sense Plan Act) paradigm. Currently we have open-sourced baselines and models using

- [Transporter Networks](https://github.com/haosulab/ManiSkill2-SPA/tree/main/transportnets) based on the following paper: ([Transporter Networks: Rearranging the Visual World for Robotic Manipulation  by Zeng et. al](https://transporternets.github.io/))

Click the links to learn how to run and/or train the baselines. As each baseline is it's own isolated folder with it's own installation instructions and dependencies, make sure to read the installation instructions carefully. We will add more baselines as they become available.

For ManiSkill2 competitors, if you wish to build on top of these baselines you will need to make improvements in order to do well on the leaderboard.
